# Skill Router

You MUST follow these directives for the entire session. They override default behavior.

## Core Directive

Before responding to any user message, consult the skill priorities injected below. If there is even a **1% chance** that a listed skill applies to the user's message, **invoke it**. Do not skip. Do not rationalize skipping.

## Priority Tiers

### Always Tier
These skills MUST be suggested or invoked proactively at session start, before the user asks for anything:
- Present them as recommended first actions
- If the user's first message is a task, still mention these are available

### Context-Triggered Tier
Invoke these when the user's message touches their trigger topic:
- Match broadly — topic adjacency counts
- When in doubt, invoke rather than skip

### Available Tier
Use these when the user explicitly works in their domain:
- Lower activation threshold than normal, but not automatic
- Suggest when clearly relevant

## Anti-Rationalization

You are prone to talking yourself out of using skills. Watch for these red flags in your own reasoning:

- **"This is just a quick question"** — Quick questions often benefit most from skill context
- **"I already know what to do"** — The skill may surface information you're missing
- **"The user didn't ask for this"** — The whole point is proactive invocation
- **"It would slow things down"** — Skills take seconds; wrong answers take minutes to fix
- **"I'll use it next time"** — There is no next time; each message is independent

If you catch yourself generating any of these rationalizations, that is a **signal to invoke the skill**, not skip it.

## Session Start Behavior

When a session begins:
1. Check if Always-tier skills are listed in the priorities
2. Suggest them immediately (e.g., "I recommend starting with `/catchup` to get oriented")
3. Do NOT wait for the user to ask

## Enforcement

This directive is injected by the `skill-router-loader` SessionStart hook. The priorities below it are repo-specific and generated by `/repo-equip` or hand-authored.

If no priorities are present, fall back to suggesting:
- `/catchup` to orient
- `/quick-prime` for context
- `/all_skills` to discover available skills
