# Purpose

Execute a raw CLI command in a forked terminal.

## Instructions

- Before executing the command, run `<command> --help` to understand the command and its options.
- Raw CLI commands always run in the foreground of the forked terminal. Mode detection (interactive vs non-interactive) does not apply—the command runs as-is.
