Completed OpenClaw architecture deep-dive document via multi-model delegation. Merged all background agent outputs, verified source references, and committed.

- 4 companion references: c1-plugin-api (Codex), c2-skills (Codex), c3-memory-config (Codex), c4-rpc-methods (Codex)

- Gemini CLI failed with 429s; pivoted to Claude Explore agents
